# Contributing

All implementation and release decisions are governed by the [Audit Quality Contract](AUDIT_QUALITY_CONTRACT.md). A change that weakens its evidence, classification, coverage, reporting, consumer-action, or release gates is not acceptable without the versioned change-control process defined there.

## Engineering requirements

- Preserve the distinction between confirmed, review, blocker, and manual results.
- Do not convert heuristics or mocked behavior into confirmed accessibility verdicts.
- Keep the target repository read-only and audit output isolated.
- Keep Notes remediation-only.
- Add or update failure-case tests for behavior changes.
- Update README, manifests, embedded instructions, commands, rules, and skill references when the public interface changes.

## Development setup

```sh
npm ci
npm run audit:dependencies
npm run validate:metadata
npx playwright install chromium
npm run check
npm run test:integration
```

## Pull requests

Describe the verified behavior, files changed, commands run, results, limitations, and manual verification. Do not include generated audit artifacts, private URLs, or captured customer data.

Before opening a pull request:

```sh
npm run check
npm run test:integration
npm run test:quality-contract
npm run test:browser
npm run test:buggyland:live
npm run build:marketplace
npm run validate:marketplace
npm run test:marketplace
npm run test:marketplace-compatibility
npm pack --dry-run
```

Generated files under `marketplace/carlashub-plugin-marketplace/accessibility-audit` must be produced by `npm run build:marketplace`, not edited manually. Keep the source version, client manifests, catalog fragments, install manifest, checksum, and packaged runtime aligned. The marketplace smoke test proves packaged installation and MCP protocol startup; it does not prove that Claude, Cursor, Codex, or Copilot client UI integrations behave correctly.

`package.json` is the release-version source of truth. Prepare a version change with `npm version <version> --no-git-tag-version`; its lifecycle synchronises every source manifest, `src/version.ts`, and `CITATION.cff`, rebuilds the committed Action and marketplace payloads, and verifies their versions before returning. Do not hand-edit the version copies. Run `npm run version:check` and `npm run validate:metadata` whenever release metadata changes.

Changes to workbook output must verify required sheets, formulas, row population, relative Evidence links, absence of embedded audit images, and rendered readability.
