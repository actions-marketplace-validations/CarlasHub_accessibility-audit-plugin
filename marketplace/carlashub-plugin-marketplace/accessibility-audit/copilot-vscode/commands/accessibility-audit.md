description: Run an evidence-backed accessibility pre-audit for WCAG 2.2 A/AA and export review-ready HTML, Excel, JSON, screenshots, and a portable archive.
---

Call the installed MCP tool `run_accessibility_audit` once with the URL(s) or page-list path supplied after this command. The tool owns testing, evidence capture, report generation, graceful cancellation, and workbook validation.

Before execution, confirm the exact pages/input, the single landing-page QA URL, and the auditor in one interaction. Use the tool form when supported. The editable auditor default is `Automated`; the landing page defaults to the first resolved URL. If no target was supplied, ask for explicit HTTP(S) URLs or one XLSX, CSV, TXT, or JSON page-list file. Do not request a report template because the plugin bundles it.

Use headless desktop, mobile, and 320px reflow checks. If no supported browser is available, allow the plugin to install Playwright Chromium once in plugin-owned storage after confirmation. Dismiss visible consent banners before interaction checks and evidence capture. If a modal remains active, record a blocker and do not treat underlying page interactions as tested. Keep contextual component screenshots enabled and retain at most one representative image per final confirmed, blocker, or review reporting unit when capture succeeds; allow full-page screenshots only for page-level findings or unresolved blockers. Surface progress. If the user stops the tool, allow partial JSON/XLSX/ZIP generation and validation to finish, then report the run as cancelled.

Keep the target repository read-only. Do not install dependencies in or modify the target project, its governance, rules, CI, hooks, manifests, lockfiles, or source. Write only to the configured audit output directory.

Use one row for the same reusable component implementation and root cause across all affected pages, grouping repeated DOM instances within that component; keep page-specific implementations, colour treatments, behaviours, criteria, or remediation requirements separate. Do not report missing `aria-controls` alone as a WCAG failure or standalone review for ordinary disclosures/accordions, and generic disclosures/accordions do not require Escape to close. List every affected page in Affected URL(s). Preserve confirmed, review, blocker, and manual evidence types. Preserve the JSON coverage matrix and state plainly that incomplete axe results, incomplete or ambiguous interactions, unresolved focus-indicator samples, truncated link checks, sampled keyboard traversal, and untested states remain JSON/inconclusive coverage rather than workbook findings or passes. Report the exact workbook, JSON, and ZIP paths, page counts, finding and evidence counts, and validation result.

Preserve the seven bundled CarlasHub WCAG workbook sheets, order, fields, formulas, validations, and colour scheme. Do not add or rename workbook fields, columns, or worksheets during a run. Page Inventory includes requested scope and audit state; Evidence stores linked relative screenshot references with finding and test context.

Explain the result in plain language. State that the plugin tests only supplied URLs, an empty automated result is not proof of WCAG conformance, review items need the documented Test method, blockers were not tested, and guided manual checks remain outstanding. Tell the user to extract the ZIP and keep the workbook with its screenshot tree so evidence links work.
